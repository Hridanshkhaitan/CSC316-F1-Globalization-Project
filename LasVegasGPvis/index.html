        The Las Vegas Grand Prix was one of the most significant investments in motorsport history, 
        with Formula 1 and local stakeholders investing hundreds of millions of dollars into the eventâ€™s infrastructure, 
        marketing, and logistics. The gamble paid off tremendously, with the race generating an estimated 
        $1.5 billion in total economic impact for Las Vegas in 2023. This figure outperformed even Super Bowl LVIII, 
        which had an estimated economic impact of around $1 billion. The Grand Prix brought in hundreds of thousands 
        of visitors, drove record-breaking hotel occupancy rates, and boosted spending across casinos, restaurants, 
        and entertainment venues, solidifying its status as a premier global sporting event with a lasting economic footprint.
